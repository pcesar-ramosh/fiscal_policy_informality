# Fiscal Policy Effects on Wealth Distribution and Consumption under High Informality

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the research project *“Fiscal Policy Effects on Wealth Distribution and Consumption under High Informality using a Heterogeneous-Agents Model”*, developed as part of our Master's thesis at the **Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI), Lima, Peru**.

Our work builds on and extends the model proposed by **Galindo et al. (2024)**, incorporating consumption and income taxes and targeted transfers to analyze the distributional effects of fiscal policy in economies with high informality.

## 🎯 Research Question
> *What are the effects of fiscal policy on wealth and consumption distribution in an economy with high informality?*

## ✨ Contributions
1. Extends the literature on **informality** by studying its interaction with fiscal policy.  
2. Expands the use of **Heterogeneous-Agent Models (HANK)** by integrating informality as a structural feature of emerging economies.  
3. Evaluates fiscal policy effectiveness under different levels of informality and in the presence of shocks such as **COVID-19**.  

## 🏗️ Model Framework
- Heterogeneous agents (formal and informal workers).  
- Informal agents face:  
  - Lower wages  
  - Higher borrowing costs  
  - Exemption from income taxes  
- Fiscal policy includes:  
  - Income taxes (formal sector only)  
  - Consumption taxes (all agents)  
  - Targeted transfers to informal agents  
- Informality is exogenous and calibrated (Loayza, 2018; World Bank, 2022; IMF, 2024).  
  - We will try to extend the model allowing varying this informality probability (lambda) in future work.

## 🔬 Methodology
- Model solved using **HJB and Fokker-Planck equations**.  
- Numerical solution: **Finite Difference Method (FDM)** with an **Upwind scheme**.  
- Calibration based on emerging market data (Peru, World Bank, IMF, OECD).  

## 📊 Key Results
- **High informality** increases inequality in wealth and consumption.  
- **Cash transfers** mitigate but do not eliminate gaps.  
- **Countercyclical transfers** (COVID-19 shock scenarios) provide stronger stabilization for low-asset households.  
- Fiscal policy effectiveness is weaker in high-informality economies.
